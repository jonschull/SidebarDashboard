This is a sample text file that can be directly referenced from the sidebar.md file.

It demonstrates how to link to static files in the root directory of the application.

Benefits of this approach:
1. More intuitive for users editing the sidebar.md file
2. No need to understand Flask routes or templates
3. Works with any browser-compatible file format (txt, html, pdf, etc.)
4. Files can be organized in the same directory as sidebar.md

Example usage in sidebar.md:
```markdown
- [Test File](static_files/test.txt)
```
