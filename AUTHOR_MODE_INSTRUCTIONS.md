## AI Assistant

The AI assistant in Author Mode is configured with a friendly, content-focused personality. It will:

2. Provide guidance on content creation and organization
3. Help with markdown formatting and structure
4. Assist with publishing your content

You do not need to "wake up" the AI by asking "Who are you?" - it should proactively engage with you when you enter Author Mode.
