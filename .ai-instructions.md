# AI Assistant Instructions for SidebarDashboard

## Project Overview

This is a static dashboard project with a markdown sidebar that allows users to:
1. Create and organize content using markdown files
2. View content in properly positioned windows
3. Publish changes to GitHub Pages with one click

## Key Directories and Files

- `/working-version/docs/` - Contains all the dashboard files that are served
- `/working-version/docs/sidebar.md` - The main navigation sidebar content
- `/working-version/docs/welcome.md` - The welcome page with instructions
- `/working-version/docs/js/viewer.js` - JavaScript that powers the dashboard
- `/working-version/docs/css/styles.css` - Styling for the dashboard
- `/working-version/http_server_nocache.py` - The HTTP server with publish endpoint
- `/working-version/publish.sh` - The script that handles publishing to GitHub Pages
- `/working-version/quick-test.sh` - Script to start/stop the server

## Common User Requests and How to Handle Them

### Starting the Server

When the user asks to start the server:
```bash
cd /Users/admin/CascadeProjects/SidebarDashboard/working-version
python3 http_server_nocache.py
```
Or use the quick-test.sh script:
```bash
cd /Users/admin/CascadeProjects/SidebarDashboard/working-version
./quick-test.sh start
```

### Creating New Content

When the user wants to create new content:
1. Create a new markdown file in `/working-version/docs/`
2. Suggest adding a link to the file in `sidebar.md`
3. Explain that they can view it by clicking the link in the sidebar

### Modifying Existing Content

Help the user edit markdown files in the `/working-version/docs/` directory.
Remind them that changes to `sidebar.md` will automatically refresh the sidebar.

### Publishing to GitHub Pages

When the user wants to publish:
1. Make sure the server is running
2. Tell them to click the "Publish to GitHub Pages" button in the sidebar
3. Alternatively, you can help them run the publish script directly:
```bash
cd /Users/admin/CascadeProjects/SidebarDashboard/working-version
./publish.sh
```

### Debugging Issues

Common issues and solutions:
1. **Server not starting**: Check for port conflicts or try restarting
2. **Content not updating**: Ensure cache is disabled or refresh the page
3. **Publish button not working**: Verify the server is running with the publish endpoint

## Implementation Principles

Always follow these principles when helping with this project:
1. **Keep solutions simple** - Don't over-engineer
2. **Trust working solutions** - If it works, don't reinvent it
3. **Use markdown files** for content whenever possible
4. **Maintain the same structure** that already works
5. **Avoid complicating server configurations**

## Feature Details

### Sidebar
- Fixed at 300px width
- Automatically refreshes when `sidebar.md` is updated
- Links open at sidebar + 25px position

### Publish Button
- Located at the top of the sidebar
- Executes git commands to push changes to GitHub Pages
- Shows a confirmation dialog and displays output in a popup

### Content Area
- Displays markdown or HTML content
- Default shows welcome.md with instructions
- Supports external links that open in new windows

## Testing

Simple testing approach:
1. Start server from working-version/
2. Verify sidebar loads
3. Check that links work
4. Verify publish button functions

Remember: The goal is a clean, working implementation - not a perfect one.
