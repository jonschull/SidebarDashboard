2. **Add New Content**: Create new markdown files or add images
3. **Preview Changes**: View your changes in real-time with auto-refresh
4. **Publish to GitHub Pages**: Use the publish button in the dashboard

## Key Files

- `sidebar.md` - The navigation sidebar content
- `welcome.md` - The welcome page with instructions
- `index.html` - The main dashboard HTML (don't edit unless you know what you're doing)

## Getting Started

   ```
   cd ..
   ./quick-test.sh
   ```
2. Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser

## Need Development Access?
